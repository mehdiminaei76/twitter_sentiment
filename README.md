### Overview
In this repository, I provide an overview of my ML modeling framework to predict the sentiment of twitter data. 

### Dataset
I use Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset from Kaggle. It can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis).
Given a message and an entity, the task is to judge the sentiment of the message about the entity. There are three classes in this dataset: Positive, Negative and Neutral. We regard messages that are not relevant to the entity (i.e. Irrelevant) as Neutral.
